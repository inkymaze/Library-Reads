This application uses React to classify and organize a selection of books pulled from a simple API for the user.


* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
